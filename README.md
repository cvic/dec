# dec

dec builds arbitrarily nested data structures from simple KV strings.

- Tiny codebase; tiny name
- Functionally pure
- Composable
- 100% test coverage
- Zero dependencies

:warning: Work in progress. :warning:

## Rationale

Env vars are simple key value pairs, yet they are ubiquitous. Docker config and
[12 Factor Config](http://12factor.net/config) in particular rely on this
traditional mechanism. But modern apps often require more complex data
structures for config: maps and lists.


## Usage

Coming soon :100:
